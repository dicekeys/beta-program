Got as far as initial test 4 (re)building the key.

The "previous" of "previous/next" is over-sized and wraps.  The instruction for step 4 is incomplete because the text is too large for the zone allocated on an iPhone 7.  On a later page it is even more jumbled.

Looking into the "custom recipe" option after muddling through the initial steps, there are features which are barely visible.  Are the "1" and the up/down arrows significant?  Anyone with the slightest eyesight deficiency is not going to see them.
